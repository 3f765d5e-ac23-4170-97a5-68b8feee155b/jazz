# Using AI tools to build Jazz apps

AI tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), can enhance the speed at which you build apps with Jazz.
However, for these tools to work effectively and provide better results, they need access to the relevant documentation.

## LLM docs

To provide AI tools, like Cursor, with access to Jazz docs, we've compressed the docs into a single txt file that is
more LLM-readable than a full website, which you can easily upload to your tool of choice.

## Adding docs to ChatGPT and v0

<a href="/llms-full.txt" download>Download llms-full.txt</a>

Upload the txt file in your prompt.

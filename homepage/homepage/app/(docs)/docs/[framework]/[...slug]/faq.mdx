# Frequently Asked Questions

## What makes Jazz a good long-term choice?

We're committed to Jazz being around for a long time! We understand that when developers choose Jazz for their personal projects, they're investing their time and creativity into us, and we take that responsibility seriously.
That's why we've designed Jazz with longevity in mind from the start:

- The open source nature of our sync server means you'll always be able to run your own infrastructure
- Your data remains accessible even if our cloud services change
- We're designing the protocol as an open specification

This approach creates a foundation that can continue regardless of any single company's involvement. The local-first architecture means your apps will always work, even offline, and your data remains yours.

## How established is Jazz?

Jazz is backed by some great investors and has been in development [since 2023](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/commit/d0993189d20fe78ec8b09abc3acfcf3ab738bd5d). We spent significant time researching local-first solutions, and finding the space lacking, we created Jazz. We're committed to building Jazz as a long-term, sustainable platform for local-first applications.

    Version 0.9.1 introduces local persistence for React Native apps using SQLite.
  </div>

  <h3>Add the required dependencies</h3>

  <div>
    As SQLite package we now use `@op-engineering/op-sqlite`.

    To get local persistence working, you need to add `@op-engineering/op-sqlite` as a direct dependency to your project.

    If this causes issues on your project, please let us know.
    
    In the meantime, you can use the `disabled` storage option to disable local persistence.

## Adding Group Members by ID

You can add group members by ID by using `Account.load` and `Group.addMember`.

```tsx
import { Group, Account } from "jazz-tools";

const group = Group.create({ owner: me });

const bob = await Account.load(bobsID, me, []);
group.addMember(bob, "writer");
```

Note: if the account ID is of type `string`, because it comes from a URL parameter or something similar, you need to cast it to `ID<Account>` first:

```tsx
import { Group, Account, ID } from "jazz-tools";

const bob = await Account.load(bobsID as ID<Account>, me, []);
group.addMember(bob, "writer");
```

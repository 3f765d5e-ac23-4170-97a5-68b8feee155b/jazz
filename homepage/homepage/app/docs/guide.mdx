<Slogan>Build an issue tracking app with distributed state.</Slogan>

Our issues app will be quite simple, but it will have team collaboration. <span className="text-nowrap">**Let's call it... &ldquo;Circular.&rdquo;**</span>

We'll build everything **step-by-step,** in typical, immediately usable stages. We'll explore many important things Jazz does &mdash; so **follow along** or **just pick things out.**

<h2 id="setup">Project Setup</h2>

1. Create a project from a generic Vite starter template:

    ```bash
    npx degit gardencmp/vite-ts-react-tailwind circular
    cd circular
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    You should now have an empty app running, typically at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).<br/>
    <small>(If you make changes to the code, the app will automatically refresh.)</small>

2. Install `jazz-tools` and `jazz-react`<br/>
    <small>(in a new terminal window):</small>
    ```bash
    cd circular
    npm install jazz-tools jazz-react
    ```

3. Set up a Jazz context, by modifying `src/main.tsx`:

    ```tsx subtle=1,2,3,4,13,15,16,17,19
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
    import App from "./App.tsx";
    import "./index.css";
    import { JazzReact } from "jazz-react";

    const Jazz = createJazzReactContext({
        auth: DemoAuth({ appName: "Circular" }),
        peer: "wss://mesh.jazz.tools/?key=you@example.com" // <- put your email here to receive a proper API key for later
    });
    export const { useAccount, useCoState } = Jazz;

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
        <Jazz.Provider>
            <React.StrictMode>
                <App />
            </React.StrictMode>
        </Jazz.Provider>
    );
    ```

    This sets Jazz up, extracts app-specific hooks for later, and wraps our app in the provider.

<h2 id="intro-to-covalues">Intro to CoValues</h2>

Let's learn about the **central idea** behind Jazz: **Collaborative Values.**

What if we could **treat distributed state like local state?** That's what CoValues do.

We can

-   **create** CoValues, anywhere
-   **load** CoValues by `ID`, from anywhere else
-   **edit** CoValues, from anywhere, by mutating them like local state
-   **subscribe to edits** in CoValues, whether they're local or remote

<h3 id="first-schema">Declaring our own CoValues</h3>

To make our own CoValues, we first need to declare a schema for them. Think of a schema as a combination of TypeScript types and runtime type information.

Let's start by defining a schema for our most central entity in Circular: an **Issue.**

Create a new file `src/schema.ts` and add the following:

```ts
import { CoMap, co } from "jazz-tools";

export class Issue extends CoMap {
    title = co.string;
    description = co.string;
    estimate = co.number;
    status? = co.literal("backlog", "in progress", "done");
}
```

TODO: explain what's happening

<h3>Reading from CoValues</h3>

CoValues are designed to be read like simple local JSON state. Let's see how we can read from an Issue by building a component to render one.

Create a new file `src/components/Issue.tsx` and add the following:

```tsx
import { Issue } from "../schema";

export function IssueComponent({ issue }, { issue: Issue }) {
    return (
        <div className="grid grid-cols-6 text-sm border-r border-b [&>*]:p-2 [&>*]:border-l [&>*]:border-t">
            <h2>{issue.title}</h2>
            <p className="col-span-3">{issue.description}</p>
            <p>Estimate: {issue.estimate}</p>
            <p>Status: {issue.status}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Simple enough!

<h3>Creating CoValues</h3>

To actually see an Issue, we have to create one. This is where things start to get interesting...

Let's modify `src/App.tsx` to prepare for creating an Issue and then rendering it:

```tsx subtle=5,13,14,15
import { useState, useCallback } from "react";
import { Issue } from "./schema";
import { IssueComponent } from "./components/Issue";

function App() {
    const [issue, setIssue] = useState<Issue>();

    if (issue) {
        return <IssueComponent issue={issue} />;
    } else {
        return <button>Create Issue</button>;
    }
}

export default App;
```

Now, finally, let's implement creating an issue:

```tsx subtle=1,2,3,5,6,8,23,24,25,27,28,29,30
import { useState } from "react";
import { Issue } from "./schema";
import { IssueComponent } from "./components/Issue";
import { useAccount } from "./main";

function App() {
    const { me } = useAccount();
    const [issue, setIssue] = useState<Issue>();

    const createIssue = () => {
        const newIssue = Issue.create(
            {
                title: "Buy terrarium",
                description: "Make sure it's big enough for 10 snails.",
                estimate: 5,
                status: "backlog",
            },
            { owner: me }
        );
        setIssue(newIssue);
    };

    if (issue) {
        return <IssueComponent issue={issue} />;
    } else {
        return <button onClick={createIssue}>Create Issue</button>;
    }
}

export default App;
```

Now you should be able to create a new issue by clicking the button and then see it rendered.

<div className="text-xs uppercase text-stone-400 dark:text-stone-600 tracking-wider">Preview</div>
<div className="p-3 md:-mx-3 rounded border border-stone-100 dark:border-stone-900 bg-white dark:bg-black not-prose">
    <div className="grid grid-cols-6 text-sm border-r border-b [&>*]:p-2 [&>*]:border-l [&>*]:border-t">
        <h2>Buy terrarium</h2>
        <p className="col-span-3">Make sure it's big enough for 10 snails.</p>
        <p>Estimate: 5</p>
        <p>Status: backlog</p>
    </div>
</div>

We'll already notice one interesting thing here:

- We have to create every CoValue with an `owner`!
    - this will determine access rights on the CoValue, which we'll learn about in "Groups & Permissions"
    - here we set `owner` to the current user `me`, which we get from the Jazz context / `useAccount`

**Behind the scenes, Jazz not only creates the Issue in memory but also automatically syncs an encrypted version to the cloud and persists it locally. The Issue also has a globally unique ID.**

We'll make use of both of these facts in a bit, but for now let's start with local editing and subscribing.

<h3>Editing CoValues and subscribing to edits</h3>

Since we're the owner of the CoValue, we should be able to edit it, right?

And since this is a React app, it would be nice to subscribe to edits of the CoValue and reactively re-render the UI, like we can with local state.

This is exactly what the `useCoState` hook is for!

- Note that `useCoState` doesn't take a CoValue directly, but rather a CoValue's schema, plus its `ID`.
  - So we'll slightly adapt our `useState` to only keep track of an issue ID...
  - ...and then use `useCoState` to get the actual issue

Let's modify `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx subtle=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,23,25,26,27,28,29,30,32
import { useState } from "react";
import { Issue } from "./schema";
import { IssueComponent } from "./components/Issue";
import { useAccount } from "./main";

function App() {
    const { me } = useAccount();
    const [issueID, setIssueID] = useState<ID<Issue>>();

    const issue = useCoState(Issue, issueID);

    const createIssue = () => {
        const newIssue = Issue.create(
            {
                title: "Buy terrarium",
                description: "Make sure it's big enough for 10 snails.",
                estimate: 5,
                status: "backlog",
            },
            { owner: me }
        );
        setIssueID(newIssue.id);
    };

    if (issue) {
        return <IssueComponent issue={issue} />;
    } else {
        return <button onClick={createIssue}>Create Issue</button>;
    }
}

export default App;
```

And now for the exciting part! Let's make `src/components/Issue.tsx` an editing component.

```tsx subtle=1,3,4,5,28,29,30,31
import { Issue } from "../schema";

export function IssueComponent({ issue }, { issue: Issue }) {
    return (
        <div className="grid grid-cols-6 text-sm border-r border-b [&>*]:p-2 [&>*]:border-l [&>*]:border-t">
            <input type="text"
                value={issue.title}
                onChange={(event) => { issue.title = event.target.value }}/>
            <textarea className="col-span-3"
                value={issue.description}
                onChange={(event) => { issue.description = event.target.value }}/>
            <label className="flex">
                Estimate:
                <input type="number" className="text-right min-w-0"
                    value={issue.estimate}
                    onChange={(event) => { issue.estimate = Number(event.target.value) }}/>
            </label>
            <select
                value={issue.status}
                onChange={(event) => {
                    issue.status = event.target.value as "backlog" | "in progress" | "done"
                }}
            >
                <option value="backlog">Backlog</option>
                <option value="in progress">In Progress</option>
                <option value="done">Done</options>
            </select>
        </div>
    );
}
```

<div className="text-xs uppercase text-stone-400 dark:text-stone-600 tracking-wider">Preview</div>
<div className="p-3 md:-mx-3 rounded border border-stone-100 dark:border-stone-900 bg-white dark:bg-black not-prose">
    <div className="grid grid-cols-6 text-sm border-r border-b [&>*]:p-2 [&>*]:border-l [&>*]:border-t">
        <input type="text" value={"Buy terrarium"}/>
        <input type="text" className="col-span-3" value={"Make sure it's big enough for 10 snails."}/>
        <label className="flex">Estimate: <input type="number" value={5} className="text-right min-w-0"/></label>
        <select value={"backlog"}>
            <option value="backlog">Backlog</option>
            <option value="in progress">In Progress</option>
            <option value="done">Done</option>
        </select>
    </div>
</div>

You'll immediately notice that we're doing something non-idiomatic for React: we mutate the issue directly, by assigning to its properties.

This works because CoValues intercept these edits, update their local view accordingly (React doesn't really care after rendering) and then notify subscribers of the change, who will receive a fresh, updated view of the CoValue.

<aside className="text-sm border rounded px-4 my-4 max-w-3xl [&_pre]:mx-0">
<h4 className="not-prose text-base py-2 mb-3 -mx-4 px-4 border-b">💡 A Quick Overview of Subscribing to CoValues</h4>

There are three main ways to subscribe to a CoValue:

1. Directly on an instance:
    ```ts
    const unsub = issue.subscribe(updatedIssue => console.log(updatedIssue));
    ```

2. If you only have an ID (this will load the issue if needed):
    ```ts
    const unsub = Issue.subscribe(issueID, { as: me }, updatedIssue => {
        console.log(updatedIssue)
    });
    ```

3. If you're in a React component, to re-render reactively:
    ```tsx
    const issue = useCoState(Issue, issueID);
    ```

    By the way, `useCoState` is basically just an optimized version of

    ```ts
    function useCoState<V extends CoValue>(Schema: CoValueClass<V>, id?: ID<V>): V | undefined {
        const { me } = useAccount();
        const [value, setValue] = useState<V>();

        useEffect(() => Schema.subscribe(id, { as: me }, setValue), [id]);

        return value;
    }
    ```
</aside>

We have one subscriber on our Issue, with `useCoState` in `src/App.tsx`, which will cause the `App` component and its children to re-render whenever the Issue changes.

<h3>Automatic local & cloud persistence</h3>

So far our Issue CoValues just looked like ephemeral local state. We'll now start exploring the first main feature that makes CoValues special: **automatic persistence.**

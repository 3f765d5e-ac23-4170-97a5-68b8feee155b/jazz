</Grid>

An operation represents an **individual user action**, or **10KB of data** for blobs/streams.


<Grid>
<GridItem className="col-start-1">
#### Egress:
<div className="text-sm">
- Operations sent out from Jazz Mesh, each counted once for every device it is synced out to.
- Depending on cache behavior each op should only be synced out once per connection, ideally once per device requesting it.
</div>
</GridItem>
<GridItem>
#### Operations stored:
<div className="text-sm">
- Operations that are continuously persisted.
- Includes backups, hot storage and edge caches.
</div>
</GridItem>
</Grid>

**Examples:**

The number of ops generated is highly app-specific and depends on user behaviour, but here are some examples:

<div className="text-sm">
- **Session A: 4 users co-oping 10 pages of text, typing them out as individual character inserts:**
  - 3,000 inserts/page &times; 10 pages = 30,000 ops -> 30k ops stored
  - 30,000 ops, each synced out to 3 other users -> 90k ops egress (one-time)
  - **You could have ~50 such sessions/mo within Mesh Free** and you can keep storing ~80 such texts.
  - **You could have ~500 such sessions/mo within Mesh Starter included usage** and you can keep storing ~800 such texts.
  - **You could have ~1000 such sessions/mo within Mesh Pro included usage** and you can keep storing ~1600 such texts.
  - Each further such session would cost you about {fmtPrice(90000 * pricePerTxSyncedOut)} and {fmtPrice(30000 * pricePerTxStored)} per month to keep storing the text.
- **Session B: 3 users collaborating on a canvas, moving shapes around at 10 FPS for 10s/min for 5 hours**
    - 3 users &times; 10 FPS &times; 10s/min &times; 60min/h &times; 5h = 90k ops -> 90k ops stored
    - 90k ops, each synced out to 2 other users -> 180k ops egress (one-time)
    - **You could have ~20 such sessions/mo within Mesh Free** and you can keep storing 20 such canvases.
    - **You could have ~250 such sessions/mo within Mesh Starter included usage** and you can keep storing 250 such canvases.
    - **You could have ~500 such sessions/mo within Mesh Pro included usage** and you can keep storing 500 such canvases.
    - Each further such session would cost you about {fmtPrice(180000 * pricePerTxSyncedOut)} and {fmtPrice(90000 * pricePerTxStored)} per month to keep storing the canvas.
- **Session C: A livestreamer streaming video (1GB total) to 25 viewers (combined live & on-demand)**
  - 1GB = 100,000 ops (10KB each) -> 100k ops stored
  - 100,000 ops, each synced out to 25 viewers -> 2.5M ops egress (one-time)
  - **You could have ~2 such livestreams/mo within Mesh Free** and you can keep storing 25 such videos.
  - **You could have ~20 such livestreams/mo within Mesh Starter included usage** and you can keep storing 250 such videos.
  - **You could have ~40 such livestreams/mo within Mesh Pro included usage** and you can keep storing 500 such videos.
  - Each further such livestream would cost you about {fmtPrice(2500000 * pricePerTxSyncedOut)} and {fmtPrice(100000 * pricePerTxStored)} per month to keep storing the video.

### Enterprise

Custom deployment in the cloud, your private cloud, on-premises or hybrids?

SLAs and dedicated support? White-glove integration services?

Let's talk: <a href="mailto:hello@gcmp.io">hello@gcmp.io</a>

## Custom Deployment Scenarios

<Slogan>You can rely on Jazz Mesh. But you don't have to.</Slogan>

<p>Because Jazz is open-source, you can optionally run your own sync nodes &mdash; in a variety of setups.</p>

<Grid>
<GridCard>
#### Jazz Mesh + Data Backup Node.

<p className="no-prose text-base">Connect your users to Jazz Mesh for all its benefits, but also run and connect your own data backup node (just in case.)</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Extra costs:
- Instance costs for the backup node.
- Moderate self-hosted storage costs.
- Every op is additionally synced to your backup node and counted as synced out.
</div>
</GridCard>
<GridCard>
#### Jazz Mesh + DIY Mesh.

<p className="no-prose text-base">Connect your users to Jazz Mesh, or your own nodes as a lower-performance fallback. The two networks stay in constant sync.</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Extra costs:
- N × instance cost for your sync nodes.
- Typically moderate self-hosted egress costs.
- High self-hosted storage costs.
- Every op is additionally synced to your DIY mesh and counted as synced out.
</div>
</GridCard>
<GridCard>
#### Completely DIY Mesh.

<p className="no-prose text-base">Build your own network of sync and storage nodes.
Handle networking, security and backups yourself.</p>

<div className="text-sm">
Costs:
- N × instance cost for your sync nodes.
- Very high self-hosted egress costs.
- High self-hosted storage costs.
